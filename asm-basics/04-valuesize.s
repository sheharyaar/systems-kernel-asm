Q: Why not use `rdi` directly ?

A: `rdi` cannot access individual bytes directly, so we needed a register
(as mentioned by the book). But it seems that we can access individual can be acessed
using `%dil` but only in 64-bit mode (REX prefix), a CPU running in 32-bit cannot do that. Also, 
you cannot use `%dil` together with `dh`, so the addb operation won't be possible.

You can try this by uncommenting the below program

_start:
	movq $0b0000000100000010, %rdi	
	addb %dil, %dh			
	xorb %dh, %dh			

	movq $60, %rax			
	syscall
